# CDSE Days 2021: Azure Machine Learning: Leveraging the cloud to accelerate machine learning workflows

## Abstract
We will introduce Azure Machine Learning, a platform for developers and data scientists to build machine learning services in the cloud and on the edge. Using hands-on examples, we will demonstrate tools such as (a) Azure AutoML for fully automated workflows (b) AzureML designer for graphical/drag-n-drop workflows, and (c) AzureML notebooks for more custom modeling workflows. In each of these cases, we will demonstrate end-to-end development that includes data ingestion, model training, evaluation, and deployment as API services. Along the way, we will also introduce how AzureML enables reproducible data science and supports MLOps for automated training/deployment of models.

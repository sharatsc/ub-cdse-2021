# Demos
We will walk through three separate experiences of using Azure machine learning services
* [Automated ML](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-first-experiment-automated-ml)
* [Drag-n-drop UI ("Designer")](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-designer-automobile-price-train-score)
* [Jupyter notebook](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/machine-learning/tutorial-1st-experiment-sdk-setup)

## Use case
In each of these experiences, we will the [UCI automobile price dataset](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Automobile) to predict the price of an automobile based on its attributes. You can get a copy of the dataset [here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/MicrosoftLearning/Principles-of-Machine-Learning-Python/master/Module7/Automobile%20price%20data%20_Raw_.csv)
